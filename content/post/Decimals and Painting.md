## Repetition and Non-repetition
Imagine two paintings

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:50%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; "> 
<div style="padding:20px">
<img src="/images/pattern.webp" style="width:370px; ">
This painting has a repeating pattern and is therefore predictable. 
</div>
<div style="padding:20px">
<img src="/images/no-pattern.jpg" style="width:400px;">
This painting has no consistent repetition wich means it is unpredictable.
</div>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

## What does this have to do with Decimals? 
Some decimals are easy to write, because they only have a few numbers after the point.  
e.g – $\frac{1}{2} = 0.5$     or   $\frac{12}{50} = 0.24$  
   
Sometimes it gets harder and the extension never ends, and the numbers keep repeating.    
e.g.  $\frac{1}{3} = 3.33333…$  or $\frac{87}{37}= 0.243243234…$  

These can also be written using a line over the digits that keep repeating.  
e.g.  $\frac{1}{3} = 3.\overline{3}$  or $\frac{87}{37}= 0.\overline{243}$  

All of these decimals that end or keep on going with a pattern are rational decimals.
&nbsp;

But what if the Digits did not repeat?
&nbsp;

## Irrational numbers.  
All irrational numbers have two common properties.  
•	They cannot be represented using a single fraction.  
•	They do not have a pattern in their decimal expansions.  

Here are some irrational numbers.

|  Symbol | What is it? | How to write it in numbers |
|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| $\pi$      | The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter | 3.141... |
| $\sqrt{2}$ | The ratio of a diagonal of a square to its side         | 1.414..           |
|  $\phi$  (The golden ratio)      | $1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \cfrac{1}{1 + \ddots}}}}$          |   1.1618...    |
| e   |   $1 + \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2} + \frac{1}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3} + \cdots.$ |  2.718...  |

## Generate a Painting from Decimals

The main point of irrational numbers is that their decimal expansions are unpredictable, no lines, no repeated numbers, because there is no way to find it's decimals using simple division, you don’t know what will come next.

Let’s see how this works, imagine you are making a painting, and each decimal number has a different stroke.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="center">
<div
style="
    width: 100%;
    height: 3.5rem;
    z-index:2;
    background: var(--bg);
    color: var(--bg);
    position: relative;"
></div>
<div style="margin-top:-3.5rem;z-index:1;position: relative;">
<iframe 
        src="https://editor.p5js.org/lisa-pinto/full/v08L_c1BE"
        style="border-style: none;width: 600px; height: 550px;" >

#### Summary  
• Some numbers have decimals that end, and others that do not end.  
• Decimal expansions where the patterns repeat are 'rational decimals'  
• Decimal expansions where the patterns do not repeat are 'irrational decimals'
