## Repetition and Non-repetition
Imagine two paintings

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:100%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; ">
<div class="twocolumn">
<img src="/images/pattern.webp" style="width:400px;">
</div>
<div class="twocolumn">
<img src="/images/no-pattern.jpg" style="width:400px;">
</div>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

The one on the left has a repeating pattern and is therefore predictable
The one on the right has no consistent repetition wich means it is unpredictable

Terminating decimals is when you have a fractions whose expansion is simple  
## How is this Relevant to Decimal expansions? 
e.g – $\frac{1}{2} = 0.50000$     or   $\frac{12}{50} = 0.240000$  
   
Sometime it gets harder and the extension never ends  
e.g.  $\frac{1}{3} = 3.33333… or 3.\overline{3}$  or $\frac{87}{37}= 0.243243…  or 0.\overline{243}$
  
These are represented by a line over them. 
## What is Irrational?
•	Decimals cannot be found through long division.
•	These don’t have fractions, but to put it simply, can only be described using words and equations

Table of irrational numbers

|  Constant | What is it visually | How to write it in numbers |
|:---------:|:-----------:|:----------------:|
| $\pi$      | xyz         | 3.141...         |
| $\sqrt{2}$ | xyz         | 1.141           |
|  $\phi$        | xyz          |   1.1618    |
| e   |   xyz |  1.141...  |

## Generate a Painting from Digits

The main point of irrational numbers is that their decimal expansions are unpredictable, no lines, no repeated numbers, because there is not long division, you don’t know what will come next.

Let’s see how this works, imagine you are making a painting, and each decimal number has a different stroke.
