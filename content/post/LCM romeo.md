#### Romeo and Juliet

## What are Factors and Multiples

A factor is simply a number that fits into another

</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above image, you can see that 2 fits into 6, which means 2 is a factor of 6.

A Multiple, on the other hand is a number that can be produced by multiplying a number.

</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above image, you can see that 2, 4, 6 and 8 are all multiples of 2

## Prime factors

The prime factors of a number allow you to break a number into its most basic pieces.
The Fundamental Theory of Arithmetic states that ever number can be broken down into prime numbers and their exponents.  
E.g.  
48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = $2^4$  x $3^1$  
66 = 2 x 3 x 11 = $2^1$ x $3^1$ x $11^1$  
108 = 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 = $3^3$  x $2^2$

## Using Prime factors for a lovers' Tryst  
Romeo ðŸ¤µ visits the Garden every 20 days,  
And Juliet ðŸ’ƒ visits it every 15 days,  
On what day will they meet.  

**Step 1: Find the prime factors of the two numbers**    
20 days= 2 x 2 x 5 =  $2^2$  x $5^1$  
15 days = 3 x 5 = $3^1$  x $5^1$  

**Step 2: Put all the factors of both numbers together, and select the ones that are not repeated**    
$2^2$,  $5^1$, $3^1$,  $5^1$  
$\boxed{2^2}$ ,  $\boxed{5^1}$ , $\boxed{3^1}$ , $5^1$ 

**Step 3: Multiply the Selected factors**   
$2^2$ x $3^1$ x $5^1$ = $4$ x $3$ x $5$ = $60$ days  


Letâ€™s look at how this works visually

#### Summary  
â€¢ The LCM of two numbers is the minimum amount that fits both of them.
