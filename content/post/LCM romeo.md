## What are Factors and Multiples

### A factor is simply a number that fits into another
{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="center">
<img src="/images/2factors.png" style="width:400px;">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above images, you can see that 2, 3 and 6, all fit into the number 6

### A Multiple, is a number that can be produced by multiplying a number.
{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="center">
<img src="/images/multiples.png" style="width:400px;">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above image, you can see that 2, 4, 6 and 8 are all multiples of 2
## Prime factors

The prime factors of a number allow you to break a number into its most basic pieces.
The Fundamental Theory of Arithmetic states that ever number can be broken down into prime numbers and their exponents.  
E.g.  
48 = 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 3 = $2^4$  x $3^1$  
66 = 2 x 3 x 11 = $2^1$ x $3^1$ x $11^1$  
108 = 3 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 = $3^3$  x $2^2$

## Calculating the first common multiple of two numbers.  
Romeo visits the Garden every 27 days,  
And Juliet visits it every 12 days,  
On what day will they meet.  
20 = 2 x 2 x 5 =  $2^2$  x $5^1$  
15 = 3 x 5 = $3^1$  x $5^1$  
The Lowest common multiple = $2^2$ x $3^1$ x $5^1$ = 60 days  
Let’s look at how this works visually

Summary 
• The LCM of two numbers is the minimum amount that fits both of them.
