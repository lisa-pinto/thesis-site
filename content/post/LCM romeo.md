## What are Factors and Multiples?

A factor is simply a number that when multiplied, fits perfectly into another number.

{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above image, you can see that 2 can be multiplied by 3 to get exactly 6, which means 2 is a factor of 6.

A Multiple, on the other hand is a number that can be produced by multiplying a number.

<div class="center">

</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In the above image, you can see that 2, 4, 6 and 8 are all multiples of 2

## The Problem
Juliet ðŸ’ƒ visits the Garden every 20 days,  
And Romeo ðŸ¤µ visits it every 15 days,  
On what day will they meet? 

Let's First look at this visually.

<div class="center">

</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Because 60 is the first multiple, of both 15 and 20, it is called the **Lowest common multiple** of the two numbers.

How do you Calculate this?

## Prime factors
More about Prime numbers [here](/post/gallery/)  

The prime factors of a number allow you to break a number into its most basic pieces.  
The Fundamental Theory of Arithmetic states that every number can be broken down into prime numbers and their exponents.  (More about exponents [here](/post/exponents-and-st.-ives) )  
E.g.  
48 = $2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3$  $\longrightarrow$ $\boxed{2 \times  2 \times  2 \times  2}$ x $\boxed{3}$ = $2^4$  x $3^1$  
&nbsp;

108 = $3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2$ $\longrightarrow$ $\boxed{3 \times  3 \times  3 }$ x $\boxed{2 \times  2}$ = $3^3$  x $2^2$  

&nbsp;

## Using Prime factors for a lovers' Tryst  
Juliet ðŸ’ƒ visits the Garden every 20 days,  
And Romeo ðŸ¤µ visits it every 15 days,  
On what day will they meet? 

**Step 1: Find the prime factors of the two numbers**    
20 days= 2 x 2 x 5 =  $2^2$  x $5^1$  
15 days = 3 x 5 = $3^1$  x $5^1$  

**Step 2: Put all the factors of both numbers together, and select the ones that are not repeated**    
$2^2$,  $5^1$, $3^1$,  $5^1$  $\longrightarrow$ $\boxed{2^2}$ ,  $\boxed{5^1}$ , $\boxed{3^1}$ , $5^1$ 

**Step 3: Multiply the Selected factors**   
$2^2$ x $3^1$ x $5^1$   
= $4$ x $3$ x $5$  
= $60$ days  


$\therefore$ Therefore, the **Lowest Common Multiple** of 20 and 15  is 60.

#### Summary  
â€¢ The LCM of two numbers is the minimum amount that both numbers fit into. (Both numbers are factors of the LCM)
