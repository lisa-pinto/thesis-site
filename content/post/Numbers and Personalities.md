#### The Quadrivium
c. Ancient Greece  
&nbsp;


## The Magic Behind Numbers

The Ancient Greeks defined four Liberal Arts of Numbers:   
Arithmetic, Astronomy, Geometry, and Harmony (Music).   
Numbers were considered as representatives of a purpose higher than themselves, and were connected to their occurences in nature.  
Let's look at the special characteristics of some numbers:

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div class="center">
<div
style="
    width: 100%;
    height: 3.5rem;
    z-index:2;
    background: var(--bg);
    color: var(--bg);
    position: relative;"
></div>
<div style="margin-top:-3.5rem;z-index:1;position: relative;">
<iframe 
        src="https://editor.p5js.org/lisa-pinto/full/5mNzcssyl"
        style="border-style: none;width: 800px; height: 645px"
        >

## Cursed Numbers

Some number's are unlucky for some, and unlucky for others, but others have very specific inauspicious properties.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:50%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; ">
<div style="padding:20px">
<img src="/images/13curse.jpg" style="width:400px;">
<h4>Unlucky Number 13</h4>
The 13th of the Month is considered unlucky in many European and South american cultures. Americans often skip the 13th floor of a building out of Supersition. Judas Iscariot, was the 13th member of Jesus' last supper who led him to his death.

<div style="padding:20px">
<img src="/images/6662.jpg" style="width:370px; ">
<h4>Number of the Beast</h4>
666 is refered to as 'the number of the beast' in the Book of Revelations in the Bible, which is the book relating to the Apocalypse, or the end of the world.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:100%;padding-left:10%;justify-content: center;">
<div style="padding:20px; max-width:600px">
<img src="/images/belphegor.jpg" style="width:370px; ">
<h4>Belphegor's prime</h4>
1,000,000,000,000,066,600,000,000,000,001<br>is a number that has several superstitious properties: It can be read the same way backwards and forwards; it has 666 right in the middle; and it has 13 zeroes on either side. It is also prime, so it has no other factors besides 1 and itself.
