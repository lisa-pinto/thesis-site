# Campbell's Soup Cans
Andy Warhol c. 1962
Synthetic polymer paint on thirty-two canvases
51 cm × 41 cm on each canvas


## The 2 Kinds of symbols  
At some point in your mathematical education, you will reach a point where you have both numbers and letters English and Greek, and nothing is ever the same.
But some all alphabets are not the same, there are two kinds:  
•	Variables  
•	Constants  
## Variables  
Variables are symbols which mean different things in different situations. A variable will often be dependent on another variable.  

Let’s start with 2 letters, x and y. 

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:100%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; ">
<div class="twocolumn">  
<br>Imagine x as an empty soup can,   
</div>
<div class="twocolumn">
<img src="/images/soupcan.jpg" style="width:100px;">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display: flex; width:100%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; ">
<div class="twocolumn">
Now imagine y = the frame of the artwork <br>
From these variables, we can form an equation using the = sign.  <br>
x = the soup in frame y  <br>
We can figure out x by looking at y  <br>
If y= 1, then x = clam chowder soup  <br>
If y= 2, then x = chicken noodle soup,   <br>
If y= 3, then x = cream of vegetable soup, and so on  <br>
</div>
<div class="twocolumn">
<img src="/images/allcans.jpg" style="width:600px;">
</div>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

Looking at the painting can you guess what soup will be there if y = 5?  <br>
☐ Green Pea  <br>
☐Tomato   <br>
☐Onion    <br>


Now Let’s create a real equation using x  
x = 5y  
If y = 1, then x = 5  
If y = 2, then x = 10  
If y = 3, then x = 15  
What will x be if y = 10?  
☐ 25  
☐50  
☐100  
Just like in the above soup can examples, x looks the same, but means different things depending on y.  

## Constants
A constant is a symbol that has the same meaning everywhere you use it. The word “constant”, itself means something that does not change.   
Firstly, all real numbers are constants : 1, 2, 3, 35.57, √2 etc. are all constants because their value will remain the same.  
The symbol π is a constant, that always equals 3.1412…  
Simply put, a constant is a symbol, that many years ago, was given a specific value by someone, and since then has only been used to represent that value.  
Let’s Look at some other famous Real-life constants.  

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div style="display: flex; width:100%;padding-left:10%;align-items: center; ">
<div class="threecolumn">
<img src="/images/jones.png" style="width:200px;"> 
<br> William jones was the first recorded person to use the symbol π for pi 
</div>
<div class="threecolumn">
<img src="/images/euler.png" style="width:200px;">
<br>In 1607, Leonard Euler, assigned the letter e to the value 2.7182818284….
</div>
<div class="threecolumn">
<img src="/images/gauss.png" style="width:200px;">
<br>In 1755, Gauss first assigned the letter i to √-1 
</div>
</div>

Because these symbols were set to one value so long ago, whenever they are used in modern mathematics sums, they always have the same value, thus, they are never used as variables.  
So whenever you see e, I, φ, π in a sum, they cannot mean anything else.  



 Summary  
•	Variables are symbols whose value can change    
•	Constants are symbols whose value stays the same.
