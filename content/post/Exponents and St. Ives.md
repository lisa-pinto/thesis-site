## Introduction

A Classic English poem reads:

"As I went to St Ives
I met Nine Wives
And every Wife had nine Sacs,
And every Sac had nine Cats
And every Cat had nine Kittens"

Each a each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine

There are many ways that you can combine the exponents.

At each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine
There were nine wives   9 = 9^1 wives
Each wife had nine sacks  9^1 wives x 9^1 sacks = 9^(1+1) = 9^2 sacks
Each sack had nine cats  9^2 sacks x 9^1 cats = 9^(2+1) = 9^3 cats
Each cat had nine kittens  9^3 cats x 9^1 kittens = 9^(3+1) = 9^4 kittens
