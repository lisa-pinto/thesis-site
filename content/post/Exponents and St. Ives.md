# "As I was going to St. Ives"
English Poem, c. 1730


## Introduction

A Classic English poem reads:

"As I went to St Ives  
I met Nine Wives  
And every Wife had nine Sacs,  
And every Sac had nine Cats  
And every Cat had nine Kittens"  

Each a each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine  
Let's look at how this works

At each level the exponent is increased by multiplying 9 again.  

At each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine  
There were nine wives   $\longrightarrow  9 = 9^1$ wives   
Each wife had nine sacks $ \longrightarrow  9^1$ wives x $9^1$  = $9^{1+1} = 9^2$ sacks  
Each sack had nine cats  $\longrightarrow  9^2$ sacks x $9^1$  = $9^{2+1} = 9^3$ cats  
Each cat had nine kittens $\longrightarrow  9^3$ cats x $9^1$  = $9^{3+1} = 9^4$ kittens  

Summary
• An exponent shows how many times a number has been multiplied
• Every time you multiply the number again, the exponent increases by 1
