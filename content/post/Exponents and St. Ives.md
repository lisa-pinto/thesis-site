#### "As I was going to St. Ives"
English Poem, c. 1730
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Numbers in Poetry 

A Classic English poem reads:

"As I went to St Ives  
I met Nine Wives  
And every Wife had nine Sacks,  
And every Sack had nine Cats  
And every Cat had nine Kittens"  


At each level you multiply the number 9 again. 
Let's look at how this works  

{{< rawhtml >}}
  <div class="center">
  <div
style="
    width: 100%;
    height: 3.5rem;
    z-index:2;
    background: var(--bg);
    color: var(--bg);
    position: relative;"
></div>
<div style="margin-top:-3.5rem;z-index:1;position: relative;">
    <iframe 
        src="https://editor.p5js.org/lisa-pinto/full/FteFLPTUg"
        style="border:none; height:450px; width:600px;" >
</iframe>
</div>
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

This is called an **increasing exponent**  
&nbsp;

At each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine  
There were nine wives     $\longrightarrow  9$ = $9^1$ wives
&nbsp;

Each wife had nine sacks $ \longrightarrow  9^1$ wives x $9^1$ sacks = $9^{1+1} = 9^2$ total sacks
&nbsp;

Each sack had nine cats   $\longrightarrow  9^2$ sacks x $9^1$ cats = $9^{2+1} = 9^3$ total cats 
&nbsp;

Each cat had nine kittens $\longrightarrow  9^3$ cats x $9^1$  kittens = $9^{3+1} = 9^4$ total kittens  
&nbsp;

#### Summary  
• An exponent shows how many times a number has been multiplied  
• Every time you multiply the number again, the exponent increases by 1
