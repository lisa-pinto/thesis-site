## Introduction

A Classic English poem reads:

"As I went to St Ives  
I met Nine Wives  
And every Wife had nine Sacs,  
And every Sac had nine Cats  
And every Cat had nine Kittens"  

Each a each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine

There are many ways that you can combine the exponents.

At each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine  
There were nine wives   $\longrightarrow  9 = 9^1$ wives   
Each wife had nine sacks $ \longrightarrow  9^1$ wives x $9^1$  = $9^{1+1} = 9^2$ sacks  
Each sack had nine cats  $\longrightarrow  9^2$ sacks x $9^1$  = $9^{2+1} = 9^3$ cats  
Each cat had nine kittens $\longrightarrow  9^3$ cats x $9^1$  = $9^{3+1} = 9^4$ kittens
