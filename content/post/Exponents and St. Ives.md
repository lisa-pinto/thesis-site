#### "As I was going to St. Ives"
English Poem, c. 1730
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## Numbers in Poetry 

A Classic English poem reads:

"As I went to St Ives  
I met Nine Wives  
And every Wife had nine Sacks,  
And every Sack had nine Cats  
And every Cat had nine Kittens"  

Each a each level you multiply the number 9   
Let's look at how this works

This is called an **increasing exponent**  

At each level you multiply the exponents by the number nine  
There were nine wives     $\longrightarrow  9$                 = $9^1$ wives   
Each wife had nine sacks $ \longrightarrow  9^1$ wives x $9^1$ sacks = $9^{1+1} = 9^2$ total sacks  
Each sack had nine cats   $\longrightarrow  9^2$ sacks x $9^1$ cats = $9^{2+1} = 9^3$ total cats  
Each cat had nine kittens $\longrightarrow  9^3$ cats x $9^1$  kittens = $9^{3+1} = 9^4$ total kittens  

#### Summary  
• An exponent shows how many times a number has been multiplied  
• Every time you multiply the number again, the exponent increases by 1
